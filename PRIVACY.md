# Privacy Policy

This document entails the privacy policy that you accept when adding [Manatee#6746](https://discord.com/users/643103079679393792) to a server, or as a member of a server with Manatee in it.

## Terminology

This section outlines some terms that will be used in the rest of the document.

- **Server Manager**: Anyone with the ability to add Manatee to a server or configure the server's preferences on our dashboard (usually moderators, administrators, and the owner).
- **Server Member**: Anyone who is a member of a server to which Manatee has been added.
- **Service User**: Anyone who authorizes Manatee to obtain additional information on a user other than what's publicly available (typically by using the "Login with Discord" feature on our website).

## Data Collected By Command

The following pieces of information may be collected and stored when intentionally provided by a user, either by executing a command on Discord or interacting with our website. This data will not be collected automatically. When providing data in this way, you forego any rights to the content of the data provided.

- Server configurations
- Name of slash commands that are run
- Options provided to slash commands
- Your Discord ID (ex: **281193735788953601**) and Discord tag (ex: **Cyborg#4239**)
- Timestamps when commands are executed

## Data Collected When Enabled

Manatee offers features that allow Server Managers to log events that happen within their server, including, but not limited to, the following:

- The content of any edited/deleted messages
- Details of a user involved in a moderation action (tag, ID, etc)
- Details of any users who join and leave (tag, ID, etc)

When such logging features are enabled, the information is sent directly to the designated channel and is not collected or stored by Manatee. Manatee and its developer(s) assume no responsibility for this data, and you are advised to contact the Server Managers directly with any relevant questions.

## Data Collected Automatically

Manatee may automatically collect any data needed for the standard operation of Discord bots (such as server, user, and member info). This data is cached in memory while the bot is running, and it is not stored on our servers.

## Data Collected Via Authorization

The following data may be accessed by Manatee when authorized, such as when logging to this website via Discord OAuth2. This data is also listed when you authorize Manatee.

- Your username, Discord ID, and avatar data
- List of servers your account is connected to
- Your server permissions in the aforementioned servers

## Data Storage

All data is stored on protected servers, kept within Manatee's [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can be 100% secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Agreement

By adding Manatee to your server or by being present in a server including Manatee, you consent to the policies outlined in this document. In addition, you (the Server Manager) assume the responsibility of informing your members of the contents of this document. If you, the Server Manager, do not agree to this document, you may remove Manatee from your Discord server. If you, the Server Member, do not agree to this document, you may leave the server(s) that include Manatee. If you, the Service User, do not agree to this document, you may revoke Manatee's access to your data by going to Discord > User Settings > Authorized Apps.

Manatee's developer(s) reserve the right to update this document as necessary. If you have any questions or concerns on this agreement, you may contact Manatee's developer(s) at the [support server](https://discord.com/invite/NP7F78SMzB).
